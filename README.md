This repository contains files from personal practice and exploration of React.js features and lessons as taught in the Road to React book. The goal is to use each learning session to create and explore at least 3 different app concepts, no matter how small and mundane. With each lesson learnt, the next 3 concepts will build on top of lessons already learnt and combine them with the current lesson.

I think that this will help me learn and understand the concepts better and build a mental library of use-cases that will boost my creativity in app building and deepen my understanding of the concepts.
